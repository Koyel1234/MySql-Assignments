# MySql-Assignments
This repository contains some of my MySql assignments.

These assignments were given in my B.Sc. second year. At that time I have made the three pdf files present in this repository. Recently I have made the .sql and .py files for same assignments. 

You can directly get the tables by importing .sql files or from python scripts.

You can refer to https://youtu.be/T3A-wfqtjZA and https://youtu.be/xXWUggDBrRI videos to see how to import .sql files and extract sql databases in MySQL command line respectively. You can import my .sql files and try different queries.
